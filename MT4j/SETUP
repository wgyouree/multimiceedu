Collaborative Education Toolkit
W. Greg Youree and Mengdie Hu

The cet.zip file can be imported as an Eclipse project. This
is the easiest way to use the Collaborative Education Toolkit.

Note: Requires Windows 7 or a version of linux with support
for multiple mice. Only tested with Windows 7. If you use linux,
you'll need to edit the Settings.txt file.
