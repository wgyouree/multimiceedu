Collaborative Education Toolkit
W. Greg Youree and Mengdie Hu

Requires Windows 7 for multiple mice support.

To run,

include all jars in "mt4jLibs" folder in classpath

run the cet.tests.StartWindowTest program which is located
in the "examples" directory.

It may be easiest to do this if you open the archive as
an Eclipse project.

Everything in the "cet" packages was written by our team,
and some of the MT4j source code was modified.

Features -

Hierarchical Cursors ( Instructor and Student )
	Instructor Cursor takes precedence
	Each cursor has a unique color
	
Floor Controls on a per window basis ( Instructor controls )

Conflict Policies can be created by the application developer
	- Implement AbstractConflictListener to provide new conflict
		resolution functionality
	- implement ICETOcclusionHandler to provide new occlusion
		mechanisms
		
Default Conflict Policies
	- can prevent windows from overlapping
	- can get intersection of windows in order to provide
	    some form of occlusion resolution such as transparency
	- can use ShakeDragConflictHandler to disallow more than
		one cursor to drag a window
	- supports collaborative resizing of windows, but could also
		implement a different conflict handler
